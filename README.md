Working on this Stardew Valley mod taught us a lot about C# and game modding. We used Content Patcher to change Lewis' dialogue and appearance by first unpacking content folder and editing JSON files to add new sprites. We made mistakes like trying to use FromFile the wrong way or having wrong folder structures, but after running the game, the SMAPI messages helped us fix them. We also used some softwares like GIMP to edit pixelated art and a Stardew Valley portrait maker (https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator) to create our character's portrait. We learned C# features like some "load" actions, simple file paths with the help from Content Patcher. The Stardew Valley Wiki page and modding guides were really helpful when we got stuck. In our collaboration, Philip handled all the art editing (GIMP and portrait maker) and manifest code while Matthew edited all the dialogue lines as well as the content code. At the end, seeing our work showing up in the game was exciting and the most important thing we learned was that testing small changes first saves a lot of time as we can easily find errors and fix them. Overall, our project replaced all Lewis' dialogue with modern Gen Z slang and changed the character appearance into Lebron James.
